Technical Challenge for Critical Mass 2022
# Work / Project Examples

1. Project 1: U of A ESS 2022 By-Election Campaign Website: [Vote Eric & Philip!](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~hongchen/)
   For this project, I was responsible for designing, coding, and uploading the website for our campaign in  the 2022 ESS By-election for VP Finance. The frontend was created using Bootstrap Studio and hosted on the U  of A sites service. Using Bootstrap Studio provided the HTML and CSS template and styling without having to create everything from scratch as the entire project needed to be completed within the day. Photos were taken by myself and Adrian Wattamaniuk.
   
2. Project 2: [BTFM](https://btfm.ca) 
     is streetwear my friend Andy and I created during the pandemic as a creative and technical outlet. I created the designs using Photoshop, transferred them via HTV to the sweater using a Cricut vinyl cutter, and uploaded the item images to the Square site. Product and model images were taken by myself and Andy Chung.
3. Project 3: FSAE EV
   I am a powertrain lead for the U of A FSAE EV division. For this project, I researched electric motors based on torque and output power requirements. Once the motor was selected and purchased, I collaborated with the rest of the EV team to retrofit a gasoline gokart with the new electric motor and battery to demonstrate feasibility before we continue with the retrofit of a full-sized FSAE racecar with a larger battery and electric motor. During the gokart retrofit, I cut aluminum sheets to size using an angle grinder as a mounting base for the motor and afixed them to the gokart.
   
# Inspiration

Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.
1. Project 1: [Vinyl Emulator](https://www.hackster.io/mark-hank/sonos-spotify-vinyl-emulator-3be63d)
   This project inspired me since I am interested in embedded systems; the Raspberry Pi is a great tool for creating small, self-contained devices, such as a "record player". The Spotify api integration is really interesting to me for its ability call upon Spotify's song database to play music after scanning an NFC tag with the relevant call details. IoT is also another interest of mine and this integrates well into a connected home system.
2. Project 2: [Automatic Shirt Folding Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhWaHSUVGco&t=8s)
   This project is really interesting to me since I think about automating laundry folding everytime I fold my clothes when I take them out of the dryer. The motor control assembly and 3D printed adapter parts for the motor are the coolest part of the project because 3D printing is another major hobby of mine. The coding aspect of the project to control the motor functions is also very interesting since the maker was able to see their changes to control and adjust the rotation speed and duration in real-time. Overall, this project combines CAD work, embedded systems, and mechanical design, all of which greatly interests me.
3. Project 3: [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
   I recently completed an interation of this project on a spare 21" TV and a Raspberry Pi 3B, and I was amazed at the customization options within the modular system. The integration of the individual modules (my favourite being the NowPlayingOnSpotify) within the broader smart mirror is fascinating to me, not to mention the technical capabilities of the modules themselves. The software is understandable even without much technical experience and I was able to customise my MagicMirror just by following the guides provided. Overall, this project showcases api integration in an easy to read at-a-glance implementation very well, and I hope to have a chance to develop my own MagicMirror module in the future.

# Focus

A project idea that I have had for a while is a Peters' Milkshake flavour combinator; the milkshake flavour menu at Peters' is quite daunting to browse, and having an app that combines up to 3 flavours for you seems like a fun way to try new flavours and discover your next favourite combination (my current one is Maple Walnut + Marshmallow). It would be quite easy to build a random combo generator, but this would inevitably create some very *interesting* milkshakes. Another level to this would use word2vec and sentiment analysis to group similar flavours together (i.e. berries, fruits, etc.) to intelligently combine the flavours instead of by random chance.
